            <h2>What We Do? </h2>
            <br>
            <p>We develop a real-time face mask detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning 
              to identify whether a person is wearing a mask. Through a simple web interface built with Flask, 
              users can access live webcam detection and see results instantly.
